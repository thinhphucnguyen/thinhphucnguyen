# Hi, I’m Thinh Phuc Nguyen 👋  
I’m an Electrical & Computer Engineering student in Boston, MA. 
I build real-world systems: kernel modules, cross-compiled firmware, real-time vision pipelines, RL agents and anything I am inspired to build at any given time!

## 🚀 Some of my projects

### **Image Deconvolution – “Deblur-my-cat”**  
C++ · FFTW · stb_image  
A weekend project implementing FFT-based image blurring and deblurring using Tikhonov and Wiener regularization.   
→ Generates a custom Gaussian PSF and restores degraded images.

### **Embedded Qt Game – Senior Design Text Glasses Project**  
C++ · Qt · Embedded Linux  
Senior design project: Text-display glasses using an embedded Linux board, custom graphics UI, and real-time display logic.  

### **2D Game Project – BattleShip Game**  
C++ · SDL/Qt/snippet  
Classic Battleship game implemented from scratch: full game logic, AI opponent, clean UI.

### **Data Structures & Algorithms Repository**  
C++ · Heaps · Splay Trees · Timsort Hybrid · B+ Trees  
A collection of custom implementations showcasing deep understanding of core data-structures and algorithmic optimizations.

### **Swarm Robotics Simulation (Coming Soon)**  
C++/Python · ROS · Simulation · Multi-agent  
Prototype simulation of robotic swarm behaviours for search & rescue or event applications. (Work in progress)
