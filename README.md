## 💡 About Me

I'm passionate about building systems that bridge hardware and software. From **kernel modules** and **cross-compiled firmware** to **real-time vision pipelines** and **RL agents** — I create whatever inspires me at any given moment.

Currently exploring the intersection of **embedded systems**, **computer vision**, and **hardware acceleration**.
